Apache::OWA Module README
=========================

This module makes it possible to run scripts written using Oracle's PL/SQL 
Web Toolkit under Apache. This code is copyright Svante Sörmark, 
svinto@ita.chalmers.se, and distributable under the same terms as Apache.
Available from http://www.ita.chalmers.se/~svinto/

REQUIREMENTS: 
============

Apache 1.3.6
mod_perl 1.20
DBI 
DBD::Oracle
Apache::Request
Oracle PL/SQL Web Toolkit, any version should work. Tested with 1.1, 3.0 and 
4,0. Check owa.initialize to find the version-number.
Apache::DBI is optional, but highly recommended. Take a look at the benchmark
below, and you'll see why.

This module has only been tested (by me) on Solaris 2.6, Oracle 8.0.5.1.

INSTALLATION
============

Unpack the file, run "perl Makefile.PL", "make" and then "make install".
"make test" does nothing useful at the moment.

Next you need to edit your httpd.conf. Here is a sample configuration where
the database user and password is provided. Use this for applications that use
their own authentication-mechanisms, or that don't need any authenticaton. 

<Location /dir/> can be anything you want, but it will be used as the schema
when executing your pl/sql. If you don't like this you can use 
"PerlSetVar SCHEMA blabla" to override this. Example:

<Location /scott/ >
	SetHandler perl-script
	PerlHandler Apache::OWA
	PerlSetVar DAD scott/tiger@oracle1
</Location>

This means that calling "http://server/scott/print_cgi_env" executes the 
pl/sql procedure "scott.print_cgi_env". If you write:

<Location /scott/ >
	SetHandler perl-script
	PerlHandler Apache::OWA
	PerlSetVar DAD scott/tiger@oracle1
	PerlSetVar SCHEMA oas_public
</Location>

the same url would now execute "oas_public.cgi_print_env".


Next, a configuration where all users have to log in using their Oracle 
user-id and password, and applications are executed under their user-id in the 
database, but the schema works the same as adbove. This means that they need 
execute permissions on the application, proper synonyms set up and "create 
session" priveliges.

<Location /ows_db_auth/ >
        AuthName ows_db_auth
        AuthType Basic
        PerlAuthenHandler Apache::OWA
        Require valid-user
        PerlSetVar DB oracle1            # defaults to $ORACLE_SID
	PerlSetVar SCHEMA oas_public
	PerlSetVar DB_AUTH true
</Location>

The final metod is authentication using a custom database function that takes
the username and password as arguments and then returns zero for success and 
non-zero for failure. The format of the DB_PROC_AUTH variable is: 
<schema>.<function>. Remember that the user in the DAD-string needs permission
to execute this function.

<Location /ows_db_proc_auth/*>
        AuthName db_proc_auth
        AuthType Basic
        PerlAuthenHandler Apache::OWA
        Require valid-user

        PerlSetVar DAD user/password@oracle
	PerlSetVar DB_PROC_AUTH user.authen
</Location>

BUGS
====

Probably lots. Here's the ones I know about.
- Headers get screwed up sometimes. I don't know if this is my fault, Oracle's 
or mod_perl's fault.
- Url -> pl/sql procedure-name translation is a bit flaky.


TODO
====
Contributions are welcome!
- owa.auth_scheme checking not implemented.
- owa.protection_realm checking not implemented.
- No transaction support. I've never used it and don't know how it works.
Maybe Apache::SESSION could be used for this?
- Maybe my authentication-stuff could be merged wuth Apache::AuthDBI ?

CREDITS
=======
Support for owa_util.point and ICX_OWA_PARMS.ARRAY added by
Gunnar Hellekson, <g.hellekson@trilux.com> and 
Erich Morisse <e.morisse@trilux.com>
of Trilux Internet Group, Ltd.
Good work!

Many thanks to Marcelo F. Ochoa and Martin Kuzela for writing OWSKiller 
(http://www.adela.sk/kuzela/OWSKiller/), which gave me the inspiration to 
write this. If you need support for any of the things not implemented in this 
module, have a look at OWSKiller. It is much more complete.
